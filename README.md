basic game made using scratch
In Ball to the Goal, the objective is to score as many points as possible by guiding a ball to the goal net. Players control the ball using the pointer.
When the pointer touches the ball, it moves toward the goal.
If the ball reaches the net without hitting the goalkeeper, the player earns a point. However, if the ball touches the goalkeeper on its way to the goal, the player loses a point. Try to score as many goals as possible while avoiding the goalkeeper!
